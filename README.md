```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Step 1: Data Collection

Fetch raw text data from the web using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. The example scrapes Wikipedia's homepage as a starting point for corpus building.

### Implementation

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://wikipedia.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
text_data = soup.get_text()
print(text_data[:500])  # Preview first 500 characters
```

### Sample Output

```
Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ ⓘ wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ ⓘ WIK-ee-) is a free online...
```

### Best Practices

- ⚠️ Always respect `robots.txt` and rate limits
- 🔄 Extend to crawl multiple pages or use APIs like Wikipedia's
- 📈 Scale up for production datasets

---

## 🧹 Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Clean and tokenize raw text using NLTK, including tokenization, lowercasing, removing non-alphanumeric characters, and stopword elimination.

### Implementation

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Download required NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')

# Preprocess text
text = "Hey Sereena !"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
tokens = [word.lower() for word in tokens if word.isalnum()]
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stopwords.words('english')]
print(filtered_tokens)
```

### Output

```python
['hey', 'sereena']
```

### Purpose

Prepares data for model input by reducing noise and standardizing format, creating clean tokens ready for training.

### Pro Tip

For larger datasets, integrate with Hugging Face's `datasets` library for efficient data handling and preprocessing.

---

## 🏗️ Step 3: Model Architecture and Training

Implement a basic transformer block using TensorFlow/Keras to understand the core mechanics of LLMs. This simplified version focuses on multi-head attention and layer normalization.

### Implementation

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, LayerNormalization, MultiHeadAttention

def transformer_block(input, num_heads, key_dim):
    attention = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=key_dim)(input, input)
    attention = LayerNormalization()(attention + input)
    dense = Dense(128, activation='relu')(attention)
    output = LayerNormalization()(dense + attention)
    return output

# Build model
input_layer = Input(shape=(None, 128))
transformer_output = transformer_block(input_layer, num_heads=8, key_dim=64)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=transformer_output)
model.summary()
```

### Output

Displays model architecture summary with layers, shapes, and approximately 100K parameters.

### Purpose

Demonstrates how transformers work under the hood. This serves as a building block for understanding custom LLM architectures, though it's not trained in this example.

---

## 🎯 Step 4: Fine-Tuning the Model

Leverage Hugging Face's `transformers` library to fine-tune GPT-2 on your preprocessed data. Uses a custom dataset class and the Trainer API for streamlined training.

### Implementation

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Prepare dataset
texts = ["Hello, how are you?", "Fine-tuning is fun!"]
# ... (tokenization and CustomDataset implementation)

# Configure training
train_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    save_steps=10,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Train model
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=train_args,
    train_dataset=my_dataset
)
trainer.train()
```

### Output

- Training logs showing loss progression (typically 2-3 on tiny datasets)
- Saved checkpoints in `./results/checkpoint-1` containing:
  - `model.safetensors`
  - `optimizer.pt`
  - Configuration files

### Important Note

With a tiny dataset, training is quick but not meaningful. Use this as a template for real-world data fine-tuning.

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Testing the Model

Load the fine-tuned model and generate text from prompts to evaluate performance and validate learning.

### Implementation

```python
# Load fine-tuned model
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('/content/results/checkpoint-1')
model.to(device)

# Prepare test prompts
test_texts = [
    "Hello, how are you today?",
    "Is HTML a Programming Language?"
]

# Generate text
inputs = tokenizer(
    test_texts,
    return_tensors="pt",
    padding=True,
    truncation=True,
    max_length=50
)

outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids=inputs["input_ids"].to(device),
    max_length=50,
    temperature=0.7
)

# Display results
for i, output in enumerate(outputs):
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(f"Input: {test_texts[i]}")
    print(f"Generated: {generated_text}\n")
```

### Purpose

Validates whether the model captures dataset patterns and generates coherent, contextually appropriate responses.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### NLTK Download Errors

```python
# Manually download required data
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### Padding Errors in Tokenization

```python
# Ensure pad token is set
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
```

### Out of Memory (OOM) on GPU

Reduce resource usage:

```python
train_args = TrainingArguments(
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,  # Reduce batch size
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,   # Accumulate gradients
)
```

Or truncate sequences:

```python
tokenizer(..., max_length=256)  # Reduce from 512
```

### Checkpoint Not Found

Verify the path exists after training:

```python
import os
print(os.listdir('./results'))  # List checkpoints
```

### TensorFlow/PyTorch Conflicts

The notebook uses both frameworks. If conflicts arise:
- Run TensorFlow sections separately
- Use different virtual environments
- Install compatible versions
